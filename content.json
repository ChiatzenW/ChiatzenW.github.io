Combine last 2 step and $d[v]&gt;d[u]+1$. Remark: basically deduce that between reaching the predecessor on shortest path and the vertex, the BFS visits at least 2 other nodes. Three cases: $v$ not discovered:then $d[v]=d[u]+1$ since we will go to $v$ when exploring $u$’s neibours. $v$ is discovered and explored:Then it is enqued before $u$ thus $d[v]\\leq d[u]$1 $v$ discovered but not fully exploredTake the node that discovered $v$, this node is explored before $u$so by it is enqueued before $u$1 $d[w]\\leq d[u]$. Since $v$ discovered by $w$, $d[v]=d[w]+1\\leq d[u]+1$ Remark: the depth difference between $u$ and $v$ can’t be greater than 1 because we would explore all neighbours thus depth difference bettween neightbours cant be greater than $1$; and we know $u$ and $v$ have to be neighbours. Anyway the contradiction proof in other 2 cases uses property1 but it is pretty intuitive that the depth difference can only be smaller. 1.at any time if $v$ is enqueud after $u$ then $d(v)\\geq d(u)$ Proof: use induction.↩","link":"/2022/03/14/Key-ideas-on-proving-BFS-gives-the-shortest-path-on-unweighted-undirected-graphs/"},{"title":".config files&#39; icon is always windows in VScode","text":"Trying to modify i3 config with Vscode and noticed the icon for .config files is the Windows logo.
