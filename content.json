Combine last 2 step and $d[v]&gt;d[u]+1$. Remark: basically deduce that between reaching the predecessor on shortest path and the vertex, the BFS visits at least 2 other nodes Three case: $v$ not discovered:then $d[v]=d[u]+1$ $v$ is discovered and explored:Then it is the successor of another node ^1","link":"/2022/03/14/Key-ideas-on-proving-BFS-gives-the-shortest-path-on-unweighted-undirected-graphs/"}],"tags":[{"name":"funnies","slug":"funnies","link":"/tags/funnies/"},{"name":"random thoguhts","slug":"random-thoguhts","link":"/tags/random-thoguhts/"},{"name":"BFS","slug":"BFS","link":"/tags/BFS/"},{"name":"proofs","slug":"proofs","link":"/tags/proofs/"}],"categories":[{"name":"shorts","slug":"shorts","link":"/categories/shorts/"},{"name":"academics","slug":"academics","link":"/categories/academics/"},{"name":"algorithms","slug":"academics/algorithms","link":"/categories/academics/algorithms/"},{"name":"CSC263","slug":"academics/algorithms/CSC263","link":"/categories/academics/algorithms/CSC263/"}]}
